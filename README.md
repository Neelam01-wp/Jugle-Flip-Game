# Jungle Flip Card Memory Game

This is a simple memory matching game with a jungle theme, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The game presents a grid of cards, face down, and the player must find matching pairs by flipping two cards at a time.

## How to Play

1. Choose a difficulty level from the main menu (index.html).
2. Cards are laid face down on the game board.
3. Click on two cards to reveal their images.
4. If the cards match, they remain face up.
5. If the cards don't match, they flip back face down.
6. The goal is to match all pairs in the fewest possible moves.


## Features

### HTML (index.html, easy.html, mid.html, hard.html, secondPage.html)

* **Semantic HTML5 elements:**  Uses elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`,  and `<div>` for structuring content logically.
* **Links and Navigation:**  The `index.html` acts as the main menu linking to different difficulty levels.
* **Image elements:**  Displays the card faces using `<img>` tags.
* **Dynamic content manipulation:** JavaScript updates the HTML to flip cards and display game status.


### CSS (easy.css, mid.css, hard.css, secondPage.css)

* **Grid layout:** Used for arranging the cards in a responsive grid.
* **Card flipping animations:** Implements CSS transitions and transforms for smooth card flip effect.
* **Responsive design:** Adapts the game layout to different screen sizes.
* **Theming:** Styles the game with a jungle theme using background images/colors.


### JavaScript (easy.js, mid.js, hard.js)

* **Event listeners:** Handles card click events to trigger the flip action.
* **Game logic:** Implements the core game mechanics, including checking for matches, tracking flipped cards, and determining win conditions.
* **DOM manipulation:** Updates the card states (flipped/unflipped) and game information on the page.
* **Difficulty levels:** Separate JavaScript files (easy.js, mid.js, hard.js) manage different grid sizes and game logic for each difficulty.
